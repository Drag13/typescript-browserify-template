# Client-Server TypeScript Template

This tiny template designed as starting point for your client-server typescript application. It doesn't contain any ui framework to give you ability to use anything you want.
It includes:

* Hot reloading
* Server-side templating
* Dummy API to start with
* Karma and Jasmine for testing purposes

## Prerequisite

Please, make sure you are using **npm 5.7.0 or higher**. If no, you need to change *npm ci* command to *npm install*

## Install

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Drag13/typescript-browserify-template
npm ci
npm run install:all
```

## Start

```cmd
npm start
```

That's it! Your client and server is running now. Give it a try!
